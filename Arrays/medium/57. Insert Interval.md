# 57. Insert Interval

You are given an array of non-overlapping intervals intervals where intervals[i] = [starti, endi] represent the start and the end of the ith interval and intervals is sorted in ascending order by starti. You are also given an interval newInterval = [start, end] that represents the start and end of another interval.

Insert newInterval into intervals such that intervals is still sorted in ascending order by starti and intervals still does not have any overlapping intervals (merge overlapping intervals if necessary).

Return intervals after the insertion.

Note that you don't need to modify intervals in-place. You can make a new array and return it.

 

Example 1:

Input: intervals = [[1,3],[6,9]], newInterval = [2,5]
Output: [[1,5],[6,9]]
Example 2:

Input: intervals = [[1,2],[3,5],[6,7],[8,10],[12,16]], newInterval = [4,8]
Output: [[1,2],[3,10],[12,16]]
Explanation: Because the new interval [4,8] overlaps with [3,5],[6,7],[8,10].
 

Constraints:

0 <= intervals.length <= 104
intervals[i].length == 2
0 <= starti <= endi <= 105
intervals is sorted by starti in ascending order.
newInterval.length == 2
0 <= start <= end <= 105

# Solution

Here 3 cases will arive:

Non Overlapping intervals before given newInterval -> push into the ans vector
Overlapping of intervals and newInterval update new interval
starting point of newInterval will be min of the interval starting point
or starting point of newInterval
Ending point will be the max of interval ending point or newInterval end point.
Non overlapping intervals after the newintervals have been merged -> push ito ans vector
Time complexity - O(N)
space complexity - O(1)

Also, please do not use sorting algo here because we have already provided with sorted list.

```c++

class Solution {
public:
    vector<vector<int>> insert(vector<vector<int>>& intervals, vector<int>& newInterval) {
        vector<vector<int>> res;
        int i = 0, n = intervals.size();

        // pushing into ans before overlapping
        while (i < n && newInterval[0] > intervals[i][1]) {
            res.push_back(intervals[i]);
            i++;
        }

        // overlapping condition
        while (i < n && newInterval[1] >= intervals[i][0]) {
            newInterval[0] = min( newInterval[0], intervals[i][0] );
            newInterval[1] = max( newInterval[1], intervals[i][1] );
            i++;
        }
        res.push_back(newInterval);

        // pushing into ans after merging the overlapping ones
        while (i < n) {
            res.push_back(intervals[i]);
            i++;
        }

        return res;

    }
};
